# Designing a Modern Backend Infrastructure for a Packaging Distributor

## Overview of Requirements

The company operates as a packaging supplier with two delivery channels: **local truck deliveries** (serving areas like Syracuse, Binghamton, Watertown, Utica) and **UPS shipments** for broader reach. Currently, the website (packagingmax.com) processes all orders with UPS shipping by default, lacking support for local delivery. The goal is to build a **unified backend system** that manages *every aspect of the business*, integrating online orders, phone orders, inventory, deliveries, and accounting into one platform. Key requirements include:

* **Multi-Channel Order Management:** Capturing orders from the customer facing website and phone orders (through a VoIP-integrated system) in one place. This ensures that whether a customer orders online or via phone order, the orders follow the same workflow for fulfillment and tracking.
* **Inventory & Warehouse Management:** Tracking stock levels in real time, validating inventory for incoming orders, and updating availability on the website. If inventory isn’t sufficient, it should alert the front office to reorder (or automatically reorder and drop-ship the current order).
* **Supplier Integration (Drop Shipping):** The backend should connect with suppliers to handle cases where inventory is insufficient. For example, it can automatically send a **purchase order** to the supplier for drop shipment when needed and track that order’s status. Additionally, the system should have insight into supplier stock levels or lead times. Having *real-time visibility into supplier inventories* helps avoid accepting orders for out-of-stock items.
* **Delivery Logistics & Scheduling:** Front office and warehouse collaboration tooling coordinates driver availability with regional delivery scheduling. Warehouse staff have tooling to request time off; front office has tooling to plan regional delivery schedules. Staffing and delivery scheduling are referenced in local delivery scheduling for orders (e.g., "delivery windows" can be selected or automatically assigned based on warehouse staffing and front office-directed regional delivery scheduling to, say, Syracuse, Watertown, Binghamton, Utica, Rochester). Options to use package delivery services (UPS) or logistics services companies (e.g., Old Dominion) should be integrated. If pricing isn't available, the user interface should incorporate ticketing software. If delivery on LTS services needs to be coordinated for pricing, ticketing software (e.g., ServiceNow) should open a ticket which alerts the front office, the front office handles the tickets like tier-1 support handles tickets, and a delivery schedule should be agreed upon in the web user interface.
* For local delivery orders, the system needs to plan delivery routes and timelines based on driver schedules, truck capacity, and delivery locations. Essentially, it should function as a **Transportation Management System (TMS)** for the company’s fleet. This includes grouping deliveries optimally, scheduling drivers’ routes, and providing dispatchers and drivers with route information. Modern logistics operations use route optimization algorithms to minimize driving time and fuel cost. There are open-source tools (e.g. Google’s OR-Tools, GraphHopper) that can be integrated to compute efficient multi-stop routes and schedules. By integrating such tools, the backend can automatically generate delivery plans each day, given the orders that need local delivery.
* **Accounts Receivable/Payable & Accounting:** As a full business management platform, the backend must handle billing and payment tracking. When an order is placed on credit (for customers with net payment terms), the sale should flow into **Accounts Receivable** with an invoice generated. Likewise, any inventory purchased (or drop-ship orders from suppliers) should feed into **Accounts Payable**. A modern solution would either include an accounting module or integrate with accounting software to log these transactions. Many open-source ERP systems include accounting modules for billing, payments, and general ledger postings. This ensures that every order, whether prepaid online or invoiced, and every supplier purchase, are properly tracked financially.
* **Customer Relationship & VoIP Integration:** Integrating a **VoIP phone system** means that incoming calls and outbound calls to customers are tied into the backend. Sales representatives shuld have a unified CRM (Customer Relationship Management) view where when a customer calls, their information and order history pops up. Call logs and recordings should be saved to the customer’s profile for reference. Modern open-source CRM platforms make this possible by syncing calls and communications into a central dashboard. For example, an integrated system could use an open-source PBX (like Asterisk or FreeSWITCH) or a cloud telephony API (like Twilio) to handle calls, while the CRM side (customer database) logs these calls. This **unified customer view** improves service and sales, since staff can see past interactions alongside new orders. Notably, some open-source CRM/ERP solutions already have modules or extensions for telephony. For instance, Odoo’s CRM has a VoIP integration that supports click-to-call and incoming call pop-ups, unifying CRM with phone communication. The benefit of an open-source approach here is cost savings and flexibility: using technologies like Asterisk (open-source PBX) avoids per-seat licensing costs, aligning with the goal of no major licensing fees.

In short, the backend envisioned is essentially a **comprehensive ERP/CRM platform** tailored to a distribution company’s needs. It must cover e-commerce, order management, inventory/warehouse, delivery routing, supplier management, and accounting in one integrated system. Next, we’ll explore how similar businesses implement such systems and what modern solutions (both architectural approaches and open-source software) can be used to fulfill these requirements.

## Industry Approaches and Best Practices

Large distribution companies (like Uline, a major packaging supplier) handle these functions with tightly integrated systems. Typically, they employ a robust **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system that brings together order processing, inventory management, procurement, and financials. In distribution, an ERP serves as the central backbone tying together inventory, sales orders, purchasing, and accounting. On top of the ERP, they often have specialized subsystems or modules:

* A **Warehouse Management System (WMS)** to manage inventory storage, pick/pack operations, and shipments in the warehouse.
* A **Transportation Management System (TMS)** to manage the scheduling and dispatch of deliveries (including integration with carriers like UPS/FedEx for parcel shipments and managing their own delivery trucks).
* Integration with **carrier APIs/EDI** for shipping: for example, connecting to UPS systems to fetch shipping rates, print labels, and track packages. Likewise, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) or API integration with major suppliers allows automatic ordering and status updates. (Uline itself requires electronic integration for many of its partners, and distributors use EDI platforms to communicate orders/invoices with such large firms.)

In practice, **distributors aim for a single source of truth**: all orders feed into one system, which then handles or delegates the fulfillment steps. Modern best practices emphasize **automation and real-time data**:

* **Real-Time Inventory & Order Processing:** Inventory counts update immediately as orders are taken, and if stock is insufficient, the system kicks off procurement actions. This automation is critical to avoid delays. For instance, when an item is back-ordered, a well-integrated system will automatically generate a purchase order to the supplier and might even send a drop-ship request to fulfill the order directly to the customer. This reduces manual work and errors.
* **Route Planning & Fleet Management:** Companies with local delivery fleets employ route optimization algorithms or TMS software to reduce transportation costs and meet delivery windows. Instead of manually plotting routes, software can consider all pending deliveries for the day and compute the optimal routes (accounting for distance, traffic, and customer time windows). Open-source libraries like Google OR-Tools or GraphHopper can handle complex multi-stop route optimization problems, enabling even smaller firms to leverage sophisticated routing without expensive proprietary software. By integrating such a tool, the system can automatically assign deliveries to drivers and sequence their stops efficiently.
* **Integrated CRM and Customer Service:** When customers call to place orders or ask about orders, having an integrated CRM means the staff can enter phone orders directly into the same system that houses web orders. All order history and communication history is in one place. **Subject Matter Experts in modern logistics** stress the importance of a 360° customer view – syncing calls, emails, and orders – so that every interaction is informed by the customer’s full history. This is especially helpful for a B2B business with repeat customers and negotiated terms.

Critically, large distributors often use **commercial ERP solutions (like SAP, Oracle, or industry-specific ERP)** which come with significant licensing costs. However, there are *open-source and SME-friendly approaches* that achieve similar integration without the hefty price tag. Many small-to-medium businesses opt for open-source ERP/CRM systems or build custom solutions aligned to their processes, focusing on cost efficiency and flexibility. The next section looks at how a modern architecture can be designed, potentially using a cloud-native microservices approach, and later we will consider specific open-source software options.

## Microservices Architecture for a Logistics Platform

To achieve a flexible and scalable system, a **microservices architecture** is a compelling approach. Instead of one giant application, the system is composed of multiple **domain-focused services**, each responsible for a specific business function. These services communicate with each other asynchronously, typically via an **event bus** or message queue, forming an event-driven system. This design can mirror the modular needs of supply chain and logistics operations.

In a microservices model for this backend, we would have services such as:

* **Order Management Service:** Captures and manages the lifecycle of orders (creation, allocation, fulfillment, invoicing). This service would receive orders from the website or a phone-order interface and handle all business logic of order processing. For example, when a new order comes in, it might publish an `Order Created` event.
* **Inventory Management Service:** Maintains stock levels, locations (warehouse info), and availability. It will reserve stock for orders and decrement inventory on shipments. It also triggers **replenishment** events when stock is below thresholds. Upon an `Order Created` event, this service could respond by reserving inventory or indicating out-of-stock and initiating supplier order events.
* **Supplier/Purchasing Service:** Manages supplier information and purchase orders. If an item is out of stock or a drop-ship is needed, this service issues a **Purchase Order (PO)** to the supplier (Signode) and tracks its fulfillment. It would handle responses like `Supplier Shipped Order` to update the system when the supplier confirms shipment. This is analogous to a procurement module in an ERP.
* **Logistics/Delivery Service:** Oversees delivery scheduling and tracking. For local deliveries, it would take all orders that need local delivery and plan routes. It might interface with a routing engine (or use an internal algorithm) to assign stops to driver routes optimally. It also updates delivery status (e.g., when a driver marks an order as delivered). For UPS shipments, this service could integrate with UPS APIs to get tracking numbers, and would publish events like `Order Shipped` with tracking info. Essentially, this is the TMS component, tracking movement of goods and ensuring customers get updates.
* **Customer/CRM Service:** Stores customer info, addresses, preferences, and possibly payment terms or credit status. It would integrate with the VoIP system for call logging. It ensures that whether an order comes from phone or web, the customer’s record is unified. This service might also handle credit checks or account status if customers have credit terms (and could publish events like `Credit Hold` if needed).
* **Accounting Service:** Handles invoicing and payments. When an order is marked as fulfilled, if it was a credit sale, this service generates an invoice in Accounts Receivable. If payment is done online, it records the payment. Similarly, when inventory is reordered or a supplier drop-ship occurs, it creates a payable entry for that PO. It ensures financials are updated in sync with operations.
* **Notification Service:** (Optional) to send out communications like order confirmations, shipment notifications (email/SMS), or even low-stock alerts to staff. For instance, it might listen for an `Order Shipped` event and email the customer their tracking number.
* **Authentication/User Management Service:** Controls user access, logins for staff, and possibly a customer portal. Since this is a backend for both internal use (staff managing phone orders, warehouse, drivers) and external (customers on the website), robust auth with role-based access is needed.

These microservices would communicate mostly through events on a central **event bus**. For example, a typical flow using events (often described as a *saga* or choreography pattern) might be: a new web order comes in and is handled by the Order service, which emits an `OrderCreated` event; the Inventory service listens and reserves stock (or triggers a supplier order if needed), the Logistics service listens and schedules delivery or prepares a UPS shipment, and the Accounting service listens to create an invoice or charge the card. They all work in parallel on the same event, rather than one large synchronous process. This *decoupling* means each service is independent and can scale or be modified on its own, improving reliability and scalability. The event-driven approach also aligns well with a cloud environment where services might be distributed across containers or nodes.

To interface with the outside world (like the website front-end or admin UI for staff), a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) API Gateway** would be used. The BFF is essentially a lightweight layer that receives REST/GraphQL requests from the front-end and either aggregates data from multiple services or publishes events to the bus to initiate processes. For instance, when a customer clicks "Place Order" on the website, the front-end calls the BFF API, which then publishes the `OrderCreated` event and quickly returns an order confirmation by gathering the needed info from the relevant services. The BFF can also serve the admin front-end for employees (e.g., an interface to view the delivery schedule or to handle a phone order entry). This pattern simplifies front-end development, as the BFF can tailor the API specifically to UI needs without exposing dozens of internal microservice endpoints directly.

**Cloud-Native Considerations:** This microservice architecture would be well-suited to run on Kubernetes (the user's preference, such as Amazon EKS for a managed K8s cluster). Each service can be containerized (for example, Docker containers) and deployed to the cluster, with horizontal scaling as needed. The event bus could be implemented with open-source messaging systems – e.g. Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or even cloud-managed pub/sub services – ensuring reliable delivery of events. The **cost optimization** angle can be addressed by using open-source components (Kafka and RabbitMQ are open-source) and rightsizing the cloud infrastructure (Kubernetes allows running many small service containers on shared nodes). Container orchestration also helps achieve high availability (multiple instances of each microservice for failover) and isolates failures (if the inventory service crashes, it doesn’t take down the entire system).

While microservices add complexity, they align with a modern approach that **scales** as the business grows. Features can be developed or updated in isolation. For instance, if down the line one needs a more advanced route optimization, a specialized microservice could be added or the existing Logistics service replaced, without a complete system overhaul. This is the kind of agility that monolithic legacy systems often lack.

*(That said, implementing a microservice architecture from scratch is a significant project. An alternative path is to leverage an open-source ERP and customize it, which we will discuss next. In some cases, combining both approaches – using an open-source ERP’s modules and extending with microservices – can yield a faster result with less development from scratch.)*

## Open-Source ERP/CRM Solutions and Examples

When cost and flexibility are prime concerns, **open-source ERP/CRM platforms** are highly attractive. These are software suites that provide a wide array of business modules out-of-the-box, which can be hosted and customized without paying license fees. Many include exactly the modules needed for packaging distribution: sales orders, inventory, purchasing, accounting, and CRM. Below are a few notable examples:

* **Odoo:** A very popular open-source ERP/CRM suite (written in Python) with a modular design. Odoo offers apps for **inventory management, purchase management, sales orders, accounting, CRM, e-commerce**, and more. All modules are integrated, meaning information flows seamlessly between them – e.g., a sale deducts inventory and creates an invoice automatically. The interface is web-based and relatively user-friendly. Odoo’s open-source Community edition has no license cost (the company makes money off an Enterprise edition and hosting, but one can self-host the community version). Relevant to our needs, Odoo has a built-in e-commerce module (or it can integrate with a separate website via APIs) and has support for **delivery carriers** as well as **VoIP integration**. In fact, Odoo’s CRM can integrate with VoIP phones to log calls, and Odoo has modules for **inventory and accounting** that would cover the core operations. One potential downside is that heavy customization may require using the Odoo framework, but many businesses have succeeded in tailoring Odoo to fit distribution workflows.
* **ERPNext:** Another open-source ERP (built on the Frappe framework, also Python-based). ERPNext is known for being a full-featured suite designed for small and mid-sized businesses, and it includes modules for **accounting, inventory, sales, purchase, CRM, and even project management**. It’s designed to be relatively easy to use and form-driven. ERPNext could manage the product catalog, stock levels, customer orders, supplier POs, and invoices all in one system. It also has a web shop module and support for things like serial numbers, warehouses, etc., which might be relevant if the company deals with batch tracking or multiple stock locations. Being open-source, it can be self-hosted on a server or on Kubernetes (there are container images and helm charts maintained by the community for deploying ERPNext).
* **Apache OFBiz:** An Apache project that is more of a framework for building an ERP/commerce system. It has modules for **inventory, order management, manufacturing, accounting, CRM, and even an integrated online storefront**. OFBiz is Java-based and very powerful, but it often requires significant technical expertise to configure and extend. Some mid-sized companies use it as a base for a custom ERP. Given the preference for TypeScript and modern stacks, OFBiz might be less appealing unless the team is comfortable with Java.
* **Others:** There are several other open-source ERPs like **ADempiere/iDempiere** (Java-based, with CRM and SCM features), **Dolibarr** (PHP-based, simpler ERP/CRM for small businesses), **Metasfresh** (a modern fork of ADempiere, Java-based), and **Tryton** (another Python-based system, very modular with sales, purchase, inventory, invoicing, shipping modules). Each has its own strengths. For example, ADempiere emphasizes satisfying a broad range of supply chain needs in one software, and Tryton offers a lightweight core you can add modules to as needed.

Using an open-source ERP as the foundation could drastically reduce development time. Instead of writing every feature from scratch, you would configure existing modules and only write code for custom integrations or unique logic. For instance, **inventory management, order entry, and accounting are commodity features** – Odoo or ERPNext can handle these out of the box as they are standard ERP functions. The development effort would then focus on integrating the real-time route optimization or perhaps the telephony integration if not provided. Fortunately, open systems are quite extensible: they typically provide REST APIs or even direct extension hooks.

**Integration of VoIP and CRM:** As noted, some open-source CRM/ERP solutions already support telephony integration. Solutions like **SuiteCRM** or **Vtiger CRM** are open-source CRMs that can integrate with Asterisk PBX for a full call-center solution. The advantage of integrating VoIP into an open-source CRM is you get a unified interface: sales reps can call customers with one click and see relevant info, and inbound calls can automatically pull up customer records. The ICTCRM report (2025) highlights that modern open-source CRM + VoIP setups provide *affordability (no licensing fees)* and *customizability*, often matching the capabilities of proprietary systems at a fraction of the cost. For example, **SuiteCRM** (a fork of SugarCRM) can be paired with FreeSWITCH or Asterisk to log calls; **Vtiger CRM** has built-in phone integration features as well. Odoo, as mentioned, has its own VoIP module. If the chosen ERP/CRM doesn’t natively support VoIP, one can use APIs from a cloud service (like Twilio, which charges per call but no heavy license) and use the CRM’s API to log the call data.

**Logistics and Route Planning Modules:** Some open-source platforms have started to address delivery management. A notable example is **Fleetbase**, an open-source logistics platform that is highly modular. Fleetbase provides components akin to what we need: a **TMS (FleetOps)** for dispatching and managing routes, a **WMS/Inventory (Pallet)** for tracking stock, a **Driver mobile app (Navigator)**, a **Customer Portal** for tracking orders, and even a **finance module (Ledger)**. Essentially, Fleetbase is like a logistics OS – you can mix and match its modules. It’s open-source and can be self-hosted, and it’s designed API-first (with webhooks, real-time updates). For a scenario like PackagingMax, one could potentially integrate Fleetbase’s TMS component to handle local delivery planning and tracking while using an ERP for the back-office functions, or vice versa. The fact that Fleetbase is **open-source and cloud-agnostic** means it aligns with the desire for no vendor lock-in. Even if Fleetbase itself isn’t used, it serves as a model of the kind of modern, event-driven logistics software that could be either adopted or emulated.

**Modern SMB Logistics Practices:** Small/medium logistics companies today often piece together solutions: they might use a combination of an **ERP for core data**, a **route optimization tool or service** for deliveries, and a **CRM** for customer interactions. The vision here, however, is to unify these into a single coherent platform – which is ambitious but achievable with open-source tools. Open-source route optimizers (like GraphHopper, OSRM, or OptaPlanner) can be integrated to compute routes internally. For example, one could run a service using **Google OR-Tools** (which is a free optimization library) to solve daily routing given all delivery addresses. This could even be scheduled to run automatically each evening for next-day deliveries. By integrating the output back into the system (assigning stops to drivers and generating a manifest for each), the company can operate with the sophistication of a much larger distributor.

## Technology Stack and Infrastructure Considerations

With the requirements and possible solutions outlined, it’s important to consider the **technology stack** and how to implement this system in a cost-effective, maintainable way. Here are some considerations:

* **Programming Languages:** The user has experience with **TypeScript**, which suggests using Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) for building custom services or extending platforms. Node/TypeScript is very suitable for building APIs and event-driven microservices. It has a rich ecosystem (e.g., frameworks like Express or NestJS for REST APIs, lots of libraries for AWS integration, Twilio, etc.). For the microservices architecture, one could absolutely implement the services in Node/TS and deploy them in Docker containers. Given the openness to other languages like Java, Go, Rust: it’s worth using the right tool for each component.

  * **Node.js/TypeScript** could handle the API Gateway (BFF) and services that require a lot of I/O, such as the Order service and CRM service, since Node excels at handling concurrent requests and integrations (like calling external APIs for UPS or Twilio).
  * **Go** could be a good choice for the Logistics service (route optimization) if performance is critical or if you use libraries in Go for mapping. Go’s concurrency and low resource usage might also be helpful for an event bus subscriber processing many events.
  * **Python** might come into play if using certain libraries (for instance, Google OR-Tools for routing is accessible via Python easily). However, introducing many languages can increase complexity. It might be simplest to start with one stack (TypeScript) for most services for consistency, and only use another language where a specific advantage is clear (e.g., a Rust service if you need extremely high performance for a calculation engine).
  * **Java** could be used especially if an open-source ERP like Odoo (Python) or others is chosen, one might have to work in that language for customizations. For instance, if Odoo or ERPNext is the base, much of the logic might be done via their Python frameworks plus custom JavaScript for front-end. If not using those and building microservices from scratch, sticking to a TypeScript + maybe Python for certain tasks might align best with current skills.

* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Deploying on a cloud with **Kubernetes** is a preference stated, which enables a microservices deployment. Using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a viable path – it's a managed control plane, but you still pay for worker nodes. For cost optimization:

  * Start with minimal nodes and leverage Kubernetes auto-scaling. The microservices can each request minimal resources and scale up on demand. If workloads are typically light with occasional spikes (e.g., most orders come during business hours), auto-scaling down in off hours can save money.
  * Use managed database services rather than running your own DB in-cluster. For instance, a managed **PostgreSQL** (like AWS RDS or Aurora) can host the data for an ERP or for custom microservices. PostgreSQL is a common choice for ERP systems (Odoo and ERPNext both use it). Managed services might cost a bit more than self-hosting on EC2, but they reduce maintenance overhead (patching, backups) significantly.
  * Use open-source friendly cloud offerings. For example, if messaging is needed, one could run a Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, but that might be heavy; an alternative is to use **Amazon SQS/SNS** or **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**, which aren’t open-source but have pay-per-use pricing and remove the admin burden. However, if avoiding proprietary services is a goal, running RabbitMQ (lighter weight for smaller scale) as a deployment in K8s could suffice for the event bus.
  * **Containerization and DevOps:** Docker images would be made for each service. CI/CD pipelines (using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI) can automate building and deploying these to the EKS cluster. The configuration (Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts) for each microservice defines its resources and environment (e.g., connecting it to the message broker, database, etc.). Since cost is critical, careful monitoring is needed; using tools like Prometheus/Grafana (open source) to watch resource usage can inform where to optimize. Kubernetes allows packing multiple services on one node, so a few medium-sized VMs might run dozens of lightweight service containers if tuned correctly.
  * **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:** The advantage of cloud-native here is that if the business grows (more orders, more products), the system can scale horizontally – spin up more instances of the Inventory service or the Web API, etc., behind a load balancer. If a component fails, Kubernetes can restart it or another instance can pick up via the event-driven design. This resiliency is important for a system handling many aspects of the business; downtime in a monolithic system could halt operations, whereas a microservice failure is isolated.

* **Integration with Existing Website:** The current website (packagingmax.com) would need to be integrated with the new backend. If the site is a typical e-commerce frontend, it can be modified to call the new backend’s APIs for product data, stock availability, and placing orders. Alternatively, if replacing the front-end is an option, one could implement a new front using a modern JavaScript framework (React/Vue/Angular) that talks to the BFF API. Given the importance of local delivery, the site’s checkout process should be updated to offer local delivery for eligible addresses (e.g., ZIP codes in those four city areas), which would then trigger the appropriate logic in the backend (creating an order designated for local delivery, to be handled by the Logistics service rather than UPS). This kind of front-end logic can be powered by data from the backend (for example, an API call like `/delivery-options?zipcode=13088` could return "Local Truck Delivery" vs "UPS" options).

* **Security and Compliance:** Since this system will handle orders and potentially payments, security is paramount. Open-source tools nowadays emphasize security features – for example, open-source CRM/ERP communities have added support for two-factor auth, encryption, and compliance modules. Using standard encryption for data in transit (HTTPS, secure VoIP protocols) and in rest (database encryption, secrets management for API keys) will be necessary. Cloud providers offer solutions like AWS Secrets Manager or Kubernetes secrets to keep credentials safe. Role-based access control should be enforced in the application (e.g., only accounting role can approve a payable, only drivers can update delivery status, etc.).

* **Accounts Integration:** If the company already uses an accounting package (many SMBs use QuickBooks or similar), an interim step might be to integrate with that rather than fully replace it on day one. For example, the system could export invoices and bills to QuickBooks via an API. However, the ideal end state described is having accounting inside the platform. Open-source ERPs like ERPNext and Odoo have **complete accounting ledgers** that can produce financial statements, manage receivables/payables, and even handle taxes. It might be beneficial to eventually use those and retire external accounting software to avoid double entry.

* **Testing and Rollout:** It’s worth noting, implementing a full ERP replacement is a large project. Best practice is to phase the rollout – possibly start with one part of the system (like inventory and orders) while running old systems in parallel, then gradually migrate all functions. Data migration (customers, inventory levels, outstanding AR/AP balances) from the old home-grown system will require careful planning, as noted in distribution ERP integration guides. Migrating data accurately and ensuring all stakeholders are trained on the new system is crucial to success. Distributors often face user adoption challenges when moving to new systems, so the design should also emphasize usability and proper training for staff.

## Conclusion

Designing the backend service infrastructure in this integrated, cloud-native way will transform the company’s operations – moving from an antiquated, siloed setup to a modern, efficient platform. The core idea is to have **one system (or a tightly integrated set of services)** that handles e-commerce and phone orders seamlessly, keeps inventory in sync, automates purchasing from suppliers, plans local delivery routes, and ties everything into accounting. This is essentially building a tailor-made ERP/CRM for the business, using modern technologies.

The research into similar businesses and current technologies shows that:

* Large distributors use enterprise-grade integrated systems to achieve these capabilities, but open-source solutions exist that provide comparable functionality without huge licensing costs.
* A microservices architecture can provide the flexibility to grow and adapt, using event-driven communication to tie together services for orders, inventory, logistics, etc.. This aligns well with a Kubernetes deployment on the cloud, which the team prefers for scalability and resilience.
* Open-source ERP and CRM examples (like Odoo, ERPNext, Fleetbase, SuiteCRM) demonstrate that we can leverage community-supported platforms to cover a lot of ground: from **inventory management and sales** to **telephony integration and delivery tracking**. These can either be directly implemented or serve as inspiration for custom development.
* Modern logistics SMEs (subject matter experts) emphasize **automation, real-time data, and customer-centric views**. By integrating route optimization algorithms, real-time shipment tracking (sending customers updates automatically), and unifying communication channels, the company can greatly improve efficiency and service quality. For example, automating drop-ship orders to suppliers and updating customers with tracking info in real time leads to faster fulfillment and fewer customer inquiries.

In summary, the backend design should be a **cloud-native, modular system** – likely composed of either microservices or an open-source ERP with extensions – that covers **order management, inventory & warehouse, supplier procurement, delivery logistics, CRM, and accounting** in one ecosystem. By choosing open-source technologies and containerized deployment, the solution avoids heavy licensing fees and can be run economically (on Kubernetes clusters or even on-premise if needed), with the ability to scale as the business grows. Adopting this modern infrastructure will enable the company’s front office and back office to work in tandem: website orders can be handled with the same rigor as phone orders, the warehouse knows exactly what to pick for both local and UPS shipments, drivers get optimized routes, and management gets visibility into the entire operation – all in real time. This integrated approach will position the company to operate more like a **Uline-style well-oiled machine**, but on an open, cost-effective platform tailored to its specific needs.

**Sources:** The design principles and examples above draw on current best practices and tools in ERP and logistics software, including open-source ERP/CRM solutions, modern supply-chain microservice architecture patterns, integrated CRM+VoIP systems, and logistics optimization tools. These sources illustrate how a comprehensive system can be built without proprietary lock-in, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and cost optimization.
